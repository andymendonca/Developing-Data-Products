Developing Data Products - Course Project

For this project, we need to create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Then we need to use Slidify 
or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about the application.

The Shiny application developed for the first part of this assignment is avalilable at:

Files for the presentation are avalilable on GitHub: https://github.com/andymendonca/Developing-Data-Products
